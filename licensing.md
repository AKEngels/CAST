There is currently no final license for CAST

The following subsections of CAST have licenses and are not developed by us:

- FFTW: GPL2 or higher
- armadillo: MPL2
- lapack: BSD
- openBLAS: BSD

- Array.h: GPL2 or higher
- cg.h: BSD
- Complex.h: GPL2 or higher
- Convolution.h: GPL3 or higher
- lbfgs.h: BSD
- ls.h: BSD
- nr3.h: Numerical Recipies, _COMMERCIAL_


Somewhat unclear:
- interp_1d1.h: Looks like Numerical Recipies code, therefore commercial?
