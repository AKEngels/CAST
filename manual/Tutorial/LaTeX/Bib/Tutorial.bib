	to a minimum-energy reaction path. The method is based on the maximization

	a nudged-elastic-band algorithm. We present the results of applying
	the algorithm to transitions in three systems-the three-well potential,
	the alanine dipeptide, and a molecular ratchet-and also remark on
	some points related to the location of temperature-dependent paths
	and the nature of the transition state. (C) 2003 American Institute

  abstract = {Molden is a software package for pre- and postprocessing of computational
	chemistry program data. Interfacing to the ab initio programs Gamess-US/UK
	and Gaussian and to the semi-empirical package MOPAC is provided.
	The emphasis is on computation and visualization of electronic and
	molecular properties but, e.g., reaction pathways can be simulated
	as well. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly
	from the output of the computational chemistry programs, others are
	calculated in MOLDEN before display. The package features different
	options to display MOLecular electronic DENsity, each focusing on
	a different structural aspect: molecular orbitals, electron density,
	molecular minus atomic density and the Laplacian of the electron
	density. To display difference density, either the spherically averaged
	atomic density or the oriented ground state atomic density can be
	used for a number of standard basis sets. The quantum mechanical
	electrostatic potential or a distributed multipole expansion derived
	electrostatic potential can be calculated and atomic charges can
	be fitted to these potentials calculated on Connolly surface(s).
	Reaction pathways and molecular vibrations can be visualized. Input
	structures can be generated with a Z-matrix editor. A variety of
	graphics languages is supported: XWindows, postscript, VRML and Povray
	format.},

  title = {Development and implementation of new simulation possibilities in the {CAST} program package},
  url = {https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/13203},
  abstract = {The aim of the present work is the development and implementation of new simulation
possibilities for the {CAST} program package. Development included, among other
things, the partial parallelization of the already existing force fields, extension of the
treatment of electrostatic interactions and implementation of molecular dynamics and
free energy algorithms.
The most time consuming part of force field calculations is the evaluation of the nonbonded
interactions. The calculation of these interactions has been parallelized and
it could be shown to yield a significant speed up for multi-core calculations compared
to the serial execution on only one {CPU}. For both, simple energy/gradient as well as
molecular dynamics simulations the computational time could be significantly reduced.
To further increase the performance of calculations employing a cutoff radius, a linkedcell
algorithm was implemented which is able to build up the non-bonded interaction
list up to 7 times faster than the original algorithm.
To provide access to dynamic properties based on the natural time evolution of a system,
a molecular dynamics code has been implemented. The {MD} implementation features
two integration schemes for the equations of motion which are able to generate stable
trajectories. The basic {MD} algorithm as described in Section 1.2 leads to the sampling
in the microcanonical ({NVE}) ensemble. The practical use of {NVE} simulations is limited
though because it does not correspond to any experimentally realistic situation.
More realistic simulation conditions are found in the isothermal ({NVT}) and isothermalisobaric
({NPT}) ensembles. To generate those ensembles, temperature and pressure
control has been implemented. The temperature can be controlled in two ways: by direct
velocity scaling and by a Nose-Hoover thermostat which produces a real canonical
ensemble. The pressure coupling is realized by implementation of a Berendsen barostat.
The pressure coupling can be used for isotropic or anisotropic box dimensions with the
restriction that the angles of the box need to be 90. A crucial simulation parameter in
{MD} simulations is the length of the timestep. The timestep is usually in the rang of 1fs.
Increasing the timestep beyond 1fs can lead to unstable trajectories since the fastest
motion in the system, usually the H-X stretch vibration can not be sampled anymore.
A way to allow for bigger timesteps is the use of a constraint algorithm which constrains the H-X bonds to the equilibrium distance. For this the {RATTLE} algorithm has been
implemented in the {CAST} program. The velocity Verlet algorithm in combination with
the {RATTLE} algorithm has been shown to yield stable trajectories for an arbitrary
length of simulation time. In a first application the {MD} implementation is used in conjunction
with the {MOPAC} interface for the investigation of {PBI} sidechains and their
rigidity. The theoretical investigations show a nice agreement with experimentally obtained
results. Based on the {MD} techniques two algorithms for the determination of free
energy differences have been implemented. The umbrella sampling algorithm can be
used to determine the free energy change along a reaction coordinate based on distances
or dihedral angles. The implementation was tested on the stretching of a deca-L-alanine
and the rotation barrier of butane in vacuum. The results are in nearly perfect agreement
with literature values. For the {FEP} implementation calculations were performed
for a zero-sum transformation of ethane in explicit solvent, the charging of a sodium
ion in explicit solvent and the transformations of a tripeptide in explicit solvent. All
results are in agreement with benchmark calculations of the {NAMD} program as well
as literature values. The {FEP} formalism was then applied to determine the relative
binding free energies between two inhibitors in an inhibitor-protein complex.
Next to force fields, ab-initio methods can be used for simulations and global optimizations.
Since the performance of such methods is usually significantly poorer than force
field applications, the use for global optimizations is limited. Nevertheless significant
progress has been made by porting these codes to {GPUs}. In order to make use of these
developments a {MPI} interface has been implemented into {CAST} for communication
with the {DFT} code {TeraChem}. The {CAST}/{TeraChem} combination has been tested
on the \$H\_2 O\_\{10\}\$ cluster as well as the polypeptide met-Enkephalin. The pure ab-initio
calculations showed a superior behavior compared to the standard procedure where the
force field results are usually refined using quantum chemical methods.},
