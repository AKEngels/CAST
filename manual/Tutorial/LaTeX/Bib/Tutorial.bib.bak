	a nudged-elastic-band algorithm. We present the results of applying
	the algorithm to transitions in three systems-the three-well potential,
	the alanine dipeptide, and a molecular ratchet-and also remark on
	some points related to the location of temperature-dependent paths
	and the nature of the transition state. (C) 2003 American Institute

  abstract = {Molden is a software package for pre- and postprocessing of computational
	chemistry program data. Interfacing to the ab initio programs Gamess-US/UK
	and Gaussian and to the semi-empirical package MOPAC is provided.
	The emphasis is on computation and visualization of electronic and
	molecular properties but, e.g., reaction pathways can be simulated
	as well. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly
	from the output of the computational chemistry programs, others are
	calculated in MOLDEN before display. The package features different
	options to display MOLecular electronic DENsity, each focusing on
	a different structural aspect: molecular orbitals, electron density,
	molecular minus atomic density and the Laplacian of the electron
	density. To display difference density, either the spherically averaged
	atomic density or the oriented ground state atomic density can be
	used for a number of standard basis sets. The quantum mechanical
	electrostatic potential or a distributed multipole expansion derived
	electrostatic potential can be calculated and atomic charges can
	be fitted to these potentials calculated on Connolly surface(s).
	Reaction pathways and molecular vibrations can be visualized. Input
	structures can be generated with a Z-matrix editor. A variety of
	graphics languages is supported: XWindows, postscript, VRML and Povray
	format.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for generating a good initial guess of a transition
	path between given initial and final states of a system without evaluation
	of the energy. An objective function surface is constructed using
	an interpolation of pairwise distances at each discretization point
	along the path and the nudged elastic band method then used to find
	an optimal path on this image dependent pair potential (IDPP) surface.
	This provides an initial path for the more computationally intensive
	calculations of a minimum energy path on an energy surface obtained,
	for example, by ab initio or density functional theory. The optimal
	path on the IDPP surface is significantly closer to a minimum energy
	path than a linear interpolation of the Cartesian coordinates and,
	therefore, reduces the number of iterations needed to reach convergence
	and averts divergence in the electronic structure calculations when
	atoms are brought too close to each other in the initial path. The
	method is illustrated with three examples: (1) rotation of a methyl
	group in an ethane molecule, (2) an exchange of atoms in an island
	on a crystal surface, and (3) an exchange of two Si-atoms in amorphous
	silicon. In all three cases, the computational effort in finding
	the minimum energy path with DFT was reduced by a factor ranging
	from 50% to an order of magnitude by using an IDPP path as the initial
	path. The time required for parallel computations was reduced even
	more because of load imbalance when linear interpolation of Cartesian
	coordinates was used. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},
