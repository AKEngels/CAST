@article{Sheppard2008,
	abstract = {A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).

The Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling, assisted by energy minimization, surmounts intervening barriers in moving through successive discrete local minima in the multidimensional energy surface. The method has located the lowest-energy minimum thus far reported for the brain pentapeptide [Met5]enkephalin in the absence of water. Presumably it is the global minimum-energy structure. This supports the concept that protein folding may be a Markov process. In the presence of water, the molecules appear to exist as an ensemble of different conformations.},

	ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats.RESULTS:We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion.CONCLUSIONS:Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry.

The package features different options to display MOLecular electronic DENsity, each focusing on a different structural aspect: molecular orbitals, electron density, molecular minus atomic density and the Laplacian of the electron density. To display difference density, either the spherically averaged atomic density or the oriented ground state atomic density can be used for a number of standard basis sets. The quantum mechanical electrostatic potential or a distributed multipole expansion derived electrostatic potential can be calculated and atomic charges can be fitted to these potentials calculated on Connolly surface(s).

	ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types.RESULTS:The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here.CONCLUSIONS:Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

	Abstract = {A new method is reported for estimating absolute and relative entropies of conformers of a macromolecule. It is based on the evaluation of the covariance matrix of Cartesian positional coordinates obtainable by computer simulation and requires only calculation of a determinant. The approximation for the absolute entropy is derived using a quantum-mechanical approach and represents an upper limit for the quantum-mechanical entropy. Together with the easily accessible energy it offers a new way to calculate absolute and relative free energies of conformers. The numerical apllication of the method, which is of particular interest in the field of protein research, is demonstrated with the example of a short ?-helical polypeptide.},

abstract = {An LCAO-MO-SCF-CI model along the lines introduced by Del Bene and Jaff6 is developed that is capable of reproducing the better identified observed spectra of nitrogen heterocycles with arms error of {\~{}} 1000 cm-1. The model is applied to the spectra of pyrrole, benzene, pyridine, the diazines, symmetric triazine and symmetric tetrazine. The benzene and pyridine spectra are reproduced nearly exactly. The band observed in pyrrole at {\~{}} 6.5 eV is calculated as two bands at {\~{}} 6.5 eV, but they are assigned {\~{}}a* and not {\~{}}*. No evidence is found for the low lying 1Bzo in pyrazine, reported at {\~{}} 30400 cm-1 in pure crystals. The lowest excited singlet of sym. triazine is calculated as 1E" (n {\~{}} 7z*), not IA{\~{}} (n {\~{}} {\~{}}z), in agreement with a recent interpretation of Fischer and Small. Several bands are reassigned, and the electronic nature of the transitions discussed. Naphthalene and quin- oxaline are examined to insure that no large drift of results are met with molecules of other sizes. Comparison of eigenvalues with molecular ionization potentials is made.

abstract = {The intermediate neglect of differential overlap technique is modified and applied to the calculation of excited triplet states. the resulting method generally reproduces the transition energies of the better-classified observations withing a rms error of 1000 cm{\^{}}-1. Trends are well reproduced, and the calculated orders of n-pi{\^{}}* and pi-pi{\^{}}* triplet states are in good accord with the experimental information to date. The method is applied to benzene and the azines. The lowest four triplet states of benene are calculated in good accord with experiment. Pyridine is calcluated to have a n-pi{\^{}}* triples nearly degenerate with the lowest lying pi-pi{\^{}}* tripler, corroborating suggestions of Japar and Ramsay based on experimental information. A detailed analysis is made of th diazines, and assignments are suggested for the higher lying triplet states not yet classified or not yet observed.},

@article{Pople1967,
abstract = {A new approximate self-consistent-field method for the determination of molecular orbitals for all valence electrons of a molecule is proposed. This method features neglect of differential overlap in all electron- interaction integrals except those involving one center only. The parameters involved in the calculation are generally obtained semi-empirically. The new method is known as the Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap (INDO) method, and may be regarded as an improvement over the CNDO method proposed in Part I, in that atomic term-level splittings and unpaired spin distributions are better accom- modated. Calculations on geometries of AB. and ABa molecules are reported to substantiate the proposed method, and calculated unpaired spin distributions for methyl and ethyl radicals are discussed.},

	abstract = {For applying to a number of theoretical methodologies based on an ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical ({QM}/{MM}) molecular dynamics method connecting {AMBER}9 with {GAUSSIAN}03, we have developed an {AMBER}-{GAUSSIAN} interface ({AG}-{IF}), which can be one of the simplest architectures. In the {AG}-{IF}, only a few subroutines addition is necessary to retrieve the {QM}/{MM} energy and forces, obtained by {GAUSSIAN}, for solving a set of Newtonian equations of motion in {AMBER}. It is, therefore, easy to be modified for individual applications since {AG}-{IF} utilizes most of those functions originally equipped not only in {AMBER} but also in {GAUSSIAN}. In the present minimal implementation, only {AMBER} is modified, whereas {GAUSSIAN} is left unchanged. Moreover, a different method of calculating electrostatic forces of {MM} atoms interacting with {QM} region is proposed. Using the {AG}-{IF}, we also demonstrate three examples of application: (i) the {QM} versus {MM} comparison in the radial distribution function, (ii) the free energy gradient method, and (iii) the charge from interaction energy and forces.},
