	abstract = {Optimization of reaction paths for enzymatic systems is a challenging problem because such systems have a very large number of degrees of freedom and many of these degrees are flexible. To meet this challenge, an efficient, robust and general approach is presented based on the well-known nudged elastic band reaction path optimization method with the following extensions: (1) soft spectator degrees of freedom are excluded from path definitions by using only inter-atomic distances corresponding to forming/breaking bonds in a reaction; (2) a general transformation of the distances is defined to treat multistep reactions without knowing the partitioning of steps in advance; (3) a multistage strategy, in which path optimizations are carried out for reference systems with gradually decreasing rigidity, is developed to maximize the opportunity of obtaining continuously changing environments along the path. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach using the acylation reaction of type A Î²-lactamase as an example. The reaction mechanism investigated involves four elementary reaction steps, eight forming/breaking bonds. We obtained a continuous minimum energy path without any assumption on reaction coordinates, or on the possible sequence or the concertedness of chemical events. We expect our approach to have general applicability in the modeling of enzymatic reactions with quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical models.},

For the determination of thermally accessible minima {CAST} offers the newly developed {TabuSearch} algorithm, but algorithms such as Monte Carlo ({MC}), {MC} with minimization, and molecular dynamics are implemented as well. For the determination of reaction paths, {CAST} provides the {PathOpt}, the Nudge Elastic band, and the umbrella sampling approach. Access to free energies is possible through the free energy perturbation approach. Along with a number of standard force fields, a newly developed symmetry-adapted perturbation theory-based force field is included. Semiempirical computations are possible through {DFTB}+ and {MOPAC} interfaces. For calculations based on density functional theory, a Message Passing Interface ({MPI}) interface to the Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU})-accelerated {TeraChem} program is available.

	url = {https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/13203},
	abstract = {The aim of the present work is the development and implementation of new simulation
possibilities for the {CAST} program package. Development included, among other
things, the partial parallelization of the already existing force fields, extension of the
treatment of electrostatic interactions and implementation of molecular dynamics and
free energy algorithms.
The most time consuming part of force field calculations is the evaluation of the nonbonded
interactions. The calculation of these interactions has been parallelized and
it could be shown to yield a significant speed up for multi-core calculations compared
to the serial execution on only one {CPU}. For both, simple energy/gradient as well as
molecular dynamics simulations the computational time could be significantly reduced.
To further increase the performance of calculations employing a cutoff radius, a linkedcell
algorithm was implemented which is able to build up the non-bonded interaction
list up to 7 times faster than the original algorithm.
To provide access to dynamic properties based on the natural time evolution of a system,
a molecular dynamics code has been implemented. The {MD} implementation features
two integration schemes for the equations of motion which are able to generate stable
trajectories. The basic {MD} algorithm as described in Section 1.2 leads to the sampling
in the microcanonical ({NVE}) ensemble. The practical use of {NVE} simulations is limited
though because it does not correspond to any experimentally realistic situation.
More realistic simulation conditions are found in the isothermal ({NVT}) and isothermalisobaric
({NPT}) ensembles. To generate those ensembles, temperature and pressure
control has been implemented. The temperature can be controlled in two ways: by direct
velocity scaling and by a Nose-Hoover thermostat which produces a real canonical
ensemble. The pressure coupling is realized by implementation of a Berendsen barostat.
The pressure coupling can be used for isotropic or anisotropic box dimensions with the
restriction that the angles of the box need to be 90. A crucial simulation parameter in
{MD} simulations is the length of the timestep. The timestep is usually in the rang of 1fs.
Increasing the timestep beyond 1fs can lead to unstable trajectories since the fastest
motion in the system, usually the H-X stretch vibration can not be sampled anymore.
A way to allow for bigger timesteps is the use of a constraint algorithm which constrains the H-X bonds to the equilibrium distance. For this the {RATTLE} algorithm has been
implemented in the {CAST} program. The velocity Verlet algorithm in combination with
the {RATTLE} algorithm has been shown to yield stable trajectories for an arbitrary
length of simulation time. In a first application the {MD} implementation is used in conjunction
with the {MOPAC} interface for the investigation of {PBI} sidechains and their
rigidity. The theoretical investigations show a nice agreement with experimentally obtained
results. Based on the {MD} techniques two algorithms for the determination of free
energy differences have been implemented. The umbrella sampling algorithm can be
used to determine the free energy change along a reaction coordinate based on distances
or dihedral angles. The implementation was tested on the stretching of a deca-L-alanine
and the rotation barrier of butane in vacuum. The results are in nearly perfect agreement
with literature values. For the {FEP} implementation calculations were performed
for a zero-sum transformation of ethane in explicit solvent, the charging of a sodium
ion in explicit solvent and the transformations of a tripeptide in explicit solvent. All
results are in agreement with benchmark calculations of the {NAMD} program as well
as literature values. The {FEP} formalism was then applied to determine the relative
binding free energies between two inhibitors in an inhibitor-protein complex.
Next to force fields, ab-initio methods can be used for simulations and global optimizations.
Since the performance of such methods is usually significantly poorer than force
field applications, the use for global optimizations is limited. Nevertheless significant
progress has been made by porting these codes to {GPUs}. In order to make use of these
developments a {MPI} interface has been implemented into {CAST} for communication
with the {DFT} code {TeraChem}. The {CAST}/{TeraChem} combination has been tested
on the \$H\_2 O\_\{10\}\$ cluster as well as the polypeptide met-Enkephalin. The pure ab-initio
calculations showed a superior behavior compared to the standard procedure where the
force field results are usually refined using quantum chemical methods.},

	abstract = {Understanding Molecular Simulation: From Algorithms to Applications explains the physics behind the "recipes" of molecular simulation for materials science. Computer simulators are continuously confronted with questions concerning the choice of a particular technique for a given application. A wide variety of tools exist, so the choice of technique requires a good understanding of the basic principles. More importantly, such understanding may greatly improve the efficiency of a simulation program. The implementation of simulation methods is illustrated in pseudocodes and their practical use in the case studies used in the text. Since the first edition only five years ago, the simulation world has changed significantly -- current techniques have matured and new ones have appeared. This new edition deals with these new developments; in particular, there are sections on: . Transition path sampling and diffusive barrier crossing to simulaterare events. Dissipative particle dynamic as a course-grained simulation technique. Novel schemes to compute the long-ranged forces. Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian dynamics in the context constant-temperature and constant-pressure molecular dynamics simulations. Multiple-time step algorithms as an alternative for constraints. Defects in solids. The pruned-enriched Rosenbluth sampling, recoil-growth, and concerted rotations for complex molecules. Parallel tempering for glassy Hamiltonians Examples are included that highlight current applications and the codes of case studies are available on the World Wide Web. Several new examples have been added since the first edition to illustrate recent applications. Questions are included in this new edition. No prior knowledge of computer simulation is assumed."},
