On coding CAST:

* Try to make your code understandable, use variable names that reflect the usage and purpose and so on.

On using the git repositry:

* Make commits atomic (as small as possible). This helps tracking bugs.
* Write useful commit messages (see commit history for examples)
* If your desired commit breaks backwards compatability or simply does not compile: COMMIT TO A BRANCH!
* The master branch should be the current "nightly" build and should always compile.
* Use issues and also resolve some issues if you have time. :)
* Don't hesitate to comment on commits or issues if you have questions or suggestions
