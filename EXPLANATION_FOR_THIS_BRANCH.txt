EXPLANATION FOR THIS BRANCH

This is a special branch for Paul, which is not supposed to be merged!
Its aim is to enable QM/QM calculations with Orca for both layers.


HOW TO USE IT

- Give all Orca options as desired for the low-layer calculation.
- This includes the option "ORCAcasscf" which should be set to zero, as well as the options for the %scf-block.
- The options inside the %casscf-block (number of electron and so on) have to be given for the high-layer calculation.
- The rest of the options that changes in the high-layer calculations has to be given with the options "ORCAnew..."


HOW IT WORKS

- The section %scf with the corresponding options was added. 
  (This is something that might also be transferred to the devel branch if desired.)
- Before the high-layer calculation some Orca options are changed:
    * Method, basisset and specification are replaced by the new first line.
    * Multiplicity is changed to new multiplicity.
    * The scf-block is deactivated.
    * The casscf-block is activated.
    * The cubefiles to be plotted are set to the new ones.
- After the high-layer calculation all those options are set back to their original value.
- Furthermore the renaming of the outputfiles was changed.
